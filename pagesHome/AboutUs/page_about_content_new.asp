	<p>
		 Zip2Tax, LLC has been in the business of providing accurate and timely sales tax data 
        since 2007. Our customer base has grown quickly since then and we are pleased to have 
        obtained the trust of many Fortune 500 companies as well as thousands of small 
        organizations. <a href="/who-uses-our-services">Click here to see a few of 
        the companies that entrust us to provide their sales and use tax data.</a><br><br>

        Our staff of dedicated professionals are committed to providing superior service to all 
        of our valued customers. Our research staff retrieves tax data directly from each state's 
        department of taxation throughout  the month. In certain cases, we check directly with 
        individual municipalities to ensure the highest level of precision. We combine the 
        accuracy of automation with the caution of manual confirmation to make sure our data is 
        processed to the specifications your business requires.<br><br>
        
        Not every business and not every state have the same sales tax reporting requirements. 
		Zip2Tax understands this and has created several subscription levels to give you what 
		you need while helping you stay within your budget. From the ZIP code level that can 
		return multiple jurisdictions, to the Spot-On doorstep-level, you can get the sales 
		tax jurisdictional granularity you need and not pay for more than you'll use.<br><br>
        
        At Zip2Tax, your confidentiality is our highest priority. We adhere to stringent security 
        standards designed to protect non-public personal information against accidental or 
        unauthorized access or disclosure. Our secure servers and databases are fully protected 
        against attacks. Please read our full <a href="/Website/pagesExtra/z2t_privacypolicy.asp"
