		<p>Zip2Tax is an affordable alternative to the mega-sized tax rate 
		providers that often charge several thousands of dollars a year.</p>
		
		<p>How can Zip2Tax afford to charge so much less? The short answer 
		is that Zip2Tax relies on a small core of key personnel and we don't 
		keep staff sitting around waiting to up-sell you.</p>
				
		<p>The big tax service providers use commission-driven sales and marketing 
		staff who's sole purpose is to man phone banks and wait for 
		prospective customers. They don't tell you what their fees are until 
		after they have your personal information and they have you on 
		the phone. We publish our full rates right on our website and other 
		downloadable price lists so you can decide at your leisure if our services 
		are right for your company.</p>
		
		<p>We provide samples of our data and set-up information right on our 
		web site. Most of our customers are do-it-yourselfers who are able to 
		integrate our data for themselves. Meanwhile, our competition employs 
		dozens of programmers who are poised to sweep into your shop and 
		commandeer your databases. They have lots of helpful MBAs who 
		are eager to hold your staff hostage in long training seminars.</p>
		
		<p>Zip2Tax doesn't offer tax filing services or guarantees of audit 
		protection. We've found that the majority of our clients prefer to use 
		their own accountants, or are interested in a referral to one of our 
		affiliates who offer special deals to Zip2Tax customers. This makes it 
		possible for us to forego the stable of CPAs, tax law specialists and 
		lawyers the competition must maintain.</p>
		
		<p>Based on the trim size of our company and our commitment to stay 
		focused on what we do best - providing accurate sales and use tax data 
		affordably to autonomous businesses - the difference between us and 
		our competition is clear.</p>
