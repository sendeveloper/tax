                As I am just starting my business, I was worried about the cost. I looked into doing the 
        work myself but very quickly realized that Zip2Tax was doing a great deal more than I could 
        ever do on my own. I figured that for the cost of the service, it was roughly 5 of my 
        billing hours per month. There was no way I could do the same thing in a cost effective 
        manner.<br>
                <br>
                By subscribing to download their full database of tax data, I freed up a lot of time  to 
        develop better ways to use the data. I also can tell my customers with confidence that I 
        have  every state in the country covered, and am keeping up with tax changes and ZIP Code 
        changes.  That is a huge benefit, and the database has filing information as well which 
        saves a lot of time  having to look up codes when paying the taxes.<br>
                <br>
                Three biggest benefits of subscribing to Zip2Tax: ease of downloads, being alerted when the 
        data is ready, and the simple format the information is in. All of these have made it very 
        easy to offer a huge benefit to my website subscribers while not having to spend lots of 
        time managing it.<br>
                <br>
                I most like having the monthly updates and knowing that the ZIP Codes and tax rates have been 
        updated to the latest set of rules. Having that data available at will means I can provide 
        information  right away. My users can feel confident that they are being compliant with the 
        law and worry about their  business instead of how to stay legal.<br>
                <br>
                I would definitely recommend Zip2Tax. Trying to be compliant with the laws is tough enough 
        already. Having access to this much data and eliminating all that time and effort  will more 
        than pay for the subscription. Businesses need to concentrate on what they are  good at. 
        Paying taxes shouldn&#39;t be a strength, it should be a task and the data from Zip2Tax makes 
        it a simple.<br>
                <br>
                I am happy with the service and know it will help me and my subscribers greatly.  Being able 
        to offload the work of keeping current has saved me a lot of time and that is of  great 
        benefit as I&#39;m starting up my business. I need to focus on what I can deliver to my 
        subscribers and adding sales tax information  sets me apart to my customers.<br>

                Cost was a real issue for our company, but this subscription has a great price point!  We 
        are impressed with the uptime and the implementation ease.  After we bought a subscription 
        to Zip2Tax, we received great service. The service is virtually worry free.<br>

                We are a small online retailer and we only need sales tax for one state. It doesn&#39;t 
        make sense for us to spend a lot on sales and use tax services. We use Volusion as our store 
        vendor and they don&#39;t have support for all the  county and city tax, so we needed to do 
        that manually. Without your service,  this would be very difficult. The way your tables 
        break out all the specific  taxes is the feature I find the most useful. And, your support 
        has been superb!<br>

                We are extremely satisfied with your product. We use it quite frequently when setting up our 
        new customers who wish us to charge them sales tax. Even when they provide this information 
        to us prior to set up, we go out on the website and double check.<br>
        <br>
                Your product is so easy to use and quick. We were surfing the internet which took lots of 
        time and did not always provide the detail we needed and get from your product.<br>
        <br>
                I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is fumbling on the internet for 
        answers. We also benefit from the emails with new tax information and issues arising in that 
        arena.<br>
        <br>
                We are completely happy and wish we would have been using years ago.<br>

                We are a reseller, so our taxable sales are a small percentage of our business.  Your 
        subscription saves lots of time calculating the CORRECT amount of tax to charge,  and 
        breakdown by state, local, etc., plus the tax on shipping charges has been very useful to us. 
        Zip2Tax is a GREAT DEAL FOR THE PRICE especially when you factor what you would pay in 
        penalties under a state tax audit!<br>

                The biggest obstacle for our company, prior to buying  the sales and use Tax Tables, was that 
        we needed to replace another system that we were using. We had integrated address 
        verification and sales tax calculation with our Intech ERP system.<br>
        <br>
                After purchasing from Zip2Tax, we found you had a quality product and we liked  that we could 
        enter just the ZIP Code without city and state. We find benefit in  the user-friendly screens, 
        the rapid response time, and the accurate results.  I recommend Zip2Tax for all of the 
        features just mentioned plus less data entry for the users.<br>

                We were worried about the cost and complication of buying sales tax data services, but 
        Zip2Tax&#39;s Online Lookup took care of that for us. We use it standalone for invoicing and 
        tax returns and we really like that it only takes 10 seconds to do a lookup.<br>
