    <p>Our staff of dedicated professionals are committed
        to providing superior  service to all of our valued customers. Our
        research staff retrieves tax data directly from each state&rsquo;s
        department of taxation throughout&nbsp;  the month. In certain
        cases, we check directly with individual municipalities to ensure
        the highest level of precision. We combine the accuracy of automation
        with the caution of manual confirmation to make sure our data
        is processed to the specifications your business requires.
	</p>
      
    <p>Our service assigns a  tax rates based on the 5-digit ZIP Code and city
        combination. This combination will often generate several rows of data
        for a single ZIP Code, so our research staff has assigned a primary rate
        for each ZIP Code. The primary rate designation is determined by the
        location of the United States Postal Office.
