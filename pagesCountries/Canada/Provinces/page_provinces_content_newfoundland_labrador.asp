		<span class="firstword">In Newfoundland Labrador, the HST</span> is generally 15% on the purchase or lease price of goods and services aside from certain exceptions.  This 15% is a combination of the federal GST rate of 5% and the regional PST of 10%.

	<p>
		<span class="firstword">Taxes in Canada</span> are destination-based, meaning the sales tax rate is based, or determined from, the destination location an item is shipped to. This complicates business for retailers who need to have the exact and up-to-date sales tax rate for every shipment they make.
