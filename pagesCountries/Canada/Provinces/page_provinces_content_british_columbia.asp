		<span class="firstword">In British Columbia, the PST</span> is generally 7% on the purchase or lease price of goods and services aside from certain exceptions.  This 7% is in addition to the federal GST rate of 5% and brings the total rate for British Columbia to 12%.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="firstword">Taxes in Canada</span> are destination-based, meaning the sales tax rate is based, or determined from, the destination location an item is shipped to. This complicates business for retailers who need to have the exact and up-to-date sales tax rate for every shipment they make.

		<span class="firstword">In general</span>, a business must collect and remit all applicable sales taxes if that business sells goods or provides services in British Columbia.

	</p>
	<p>
		Shipping is frequently not taxable if stated separately on the invoice.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finance charges are often exempt from sales tax, when stated separately.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since legislators can vote to change tax rates at any time, it is very difficult for individuals to keep track of the changes. The population is also rapidly changing, which can cause frequent updates to the postal codes as well as local municipality names, which complicates the job of keeping track of sales tax jurisdictions.
