		<span class="firstword">In Alberta,</span> there is no regional sales tax on the purchase or lease price of goods and services.  Only the 5% federal GST is applicable on the purchase or lease price of goods and services in Alberta.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="firstword">Taxes in Canada</span> are destination-based, meaning the sales tax rate is based, or determined from, the destination location an item is shipped to. This complicates business for retailers who need to have the exact and up-to-date sales tax rate for every shipment they make.

		Since legislators can vote to change tax rates at any time, it is very difficult for individuals to keep track of the changes. The population is also rapidly changing, which can cause frequent updates to the postal codes as well as local municipality names, which complicates the job of keeping track of sales tax jurisdictions.
