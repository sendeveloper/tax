		What is the Canada sales tax?
	</h3>	
	
	<p><span class="firstword">In Canada, there is a federal Goods and Services Tax (GST)</span> collected on most retail purchases. 
	</p>
	<p><span class="firstword">The Canada sales tax (GST) rate</span> is currently 5%. In Canada, some provinces charge a rate on top of the GST rate.  The total rate for a location can include GST only, HST (Harmonized Sales Tax) only, or a combination of GST and PST (Provincial Sales Tax).
	</p>

	<p><span class="firstword">The Harmonized Sales Tax (HST)</span> is the combined federal and provincial rate into a single rate, used by some of the Canadian provinces including New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Prince Edward Island.  The Canada Revenue Agency collects the HST and distributes the appropriate amounts to provinces participating in the HST.
	</p>

	<p><span class="firstword">The Provincial Sales Tax (PST)</span> is the separate tax levied by some provinces including British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba (Retail Sales Tax – RST) and Quebec (Quebec Sales Tax – QST).  The PST rates vary by province.
	</p>

	<p>
		While the buyer is responsible for paying the tax, it is the seller who is normally tasked with collecting the tax from the buyer and remitting it to the Canada Revenue Agency in a timely fashion.
	</p>
	<p>
		Rates vary depending on individual province.  To see detailed information about the general sales tax rates and laws for any given province, click on the map below or use this pull down menu.

		Who has to pay Canada sales tax or use tax?
	</h3>
	<p>
		<span class="firstword">
			In general,
		</span> a business must collect and remit all applicable Canada sales taxes if that business sells goods or provides services in Canada.  The presence of an employee or salesperson, delivery by the seller's vehicle, and storage of materials can also create transactions subject to tax.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="firstword">
			Canada says
		</span> that a vendor is required to collect tax if they make sales to another province or territory. Provinces and territories have their own specific requirements for charging sales tax.

	<p><span class="firstword">Special rules applying to sales and use taxes in Canada</span></p>
	<p>
		Shipping is frequently not taxable if stated separately on the invoice.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finance charges are often exempt from sales tax, when stated separately.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since legislators can vote to change tax rates at any time, it is very difficult for individuals to keep track of the changes. The population is also rapidly changing, which can cause frequent updates to the postal codes as well as local municipality names, which complicates the job of keeping track of sales tax jurisdictions.
