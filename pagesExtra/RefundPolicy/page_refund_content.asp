	  <p class="firstword">Digital goods  - .CSV tax table downloads </p>
   <p>Sales of digital goods are final and no refunds will be given. As these
     products are digital downloads, available instantly once your order has
     been processed, it is impossible for you to return a product for a refund.</p> 
   <p>If you find a error in our database, you can report it to our <a href="mailto:mailto:support@zip2tax.com" target="_blank">support@zip2tax.com</a> and Zip2Tax will, at our discretion, fix it in the next monthly update for most single rate revisions, or fix it and reissue a new table immediately if for some reason the entire table is incorrect. 
  Finding an error is not a reason to request a refund. </p>
