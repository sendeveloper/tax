      <p>Zip2Tax, LLC has been in the business of providing accurate and timely sales 
	  tax data since  2007. Our customer base has grown quickly since then and we are 
	  pleased to have obtained the trust of many Fortune 500 companies as well as 
	  thousands of small organizations. 
      <a class="customers-link" href="/who-uses-our-services">Click here

	  data.</a></p>
      
      <p>Our staff of dedicated professionals are committed to providing superior 
	  service to all of our valued customers. Our research staff retrieves tax data 
	  directly from each state&rsquo;s department of taxation throughout&nbsp; the 
	  month. In certain cases, we check directly with individual municipalities to 
	  ensure the highest level of precision. We combine the accuracy of automation 
	  with the caution of manual confirmation to make sure our data is processed to 
	  the specifications your business requires.</p>
      
      <p>Our researchers assign a tax rate based on the 5-digit ZIP code and city 
	  combination. This combination will often generate several rows of data for a 
	  single ZIP code, so our system designates the location containing the United 
	  States Postal Office as the primary rate for those customers wishing to 
	  eliminate the extra data.</p>
      
      <p>At Zip2Tax, your confidentiality is our highest priority. We adhere to 
	  stringent security standards designed to protect non-public personal 
	  information against accidental or unauthorized access or disclosure. Our secure 
	  servers and databases are fully protected against attacks. Please read our full
