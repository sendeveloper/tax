          <p><a href="/testimonials#T1">As I am just starting my business, I was worried about the cost. I looked into doing the work myself but very quickly realized that Zip2Tax was doing a great deal more than I could ever do on my own. I figured that for the cost of the service, it was roughly 5 of my billing hours per month. There was no way I could do the same thing in a cost effective manner.</a></p>
          <p><a href="/testimonials#T1">By subscribing ... I freed up a lot of time  ...  That is a huge benefit, and the database has filing information as well which saves a lot of time  having to look up codes when paying the taxes... (Read More)</a></p>

          <p><a href="/testimonials#T4">We are a small online retailer and we only need sales tax for one state. It doesn&#39;t make sense for us to spend a lot on sales and use tax services. We use Volusion as our store vendor and they don&#39;t have support for all the  county and city tax, so we needed to do that manually. Without your service,  this would be very difficult. The way your tables break out all the specific  taxes is the feature I find the most useful. And, your support has been superb!</a></p>

We were surfing the internet which took lots of time and did not always provide the detail we needed and get from your product. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is fumbling on the internet for answers. We also benefit from the emails with new tax information and issues arising in that arena.</a></p>

          <p><a href="/testimonials#T9">We are a reseller, so our taxable sales are a small percentage of our business.  Your subscription saves lots of time calculating the CORRECT amount of tax to charge, and breakdown by state, local, etc., plus the tax on shipping charges has been very useful to us. Zip2Tax is a GREAT DEAL FOR THE PRICE especially when you factor what you would pay in penalties under a state tax audit!</a></p>

          <p><a href="/testimonials#T10">The biggest obstacle for our company, prior to buying  the sales and use Tax Tables, was that we needed to replace another system that we were using. We had integrated address verification and sales tax calculation with our Intech ERP system.</a></p>
          <p><a href="/testimonials#T10">After purchasing from Zip2Tax, we found you had a quality product and we liked  that we could enter just the ZIP Code without city and state. We find benefit in  the user-friendly screens, the rapid response time, and the accurate results.  I recommend Zip2Tax for all of the features just mentioned plus less data entry for the users.</a></p>
