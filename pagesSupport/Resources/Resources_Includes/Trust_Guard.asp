	or call 877-848-2731 for your Zip2Tax/Trust Guard discount.</p>
        <p>Through our new partnership with Trust Guard, we can help you address that concern about trust and internet security. Zip2Tax customers will receive a <b>discount price up to 70% off</b> of the Trust Guard certification. Merchants who use this certification have seen their online orders <b><b>increase 10% to 30% or more</b></b> - Why? Because shoppers are more confident in using their credit cards online when they see the Trust Guard mark.</p>

<p>The Trust Guard certification represents that a site has passed Trust Guard's rigorous daily scans to reduce the liability of hackers, identity theft, and credit card theft. Trust Guard's PCI service (described below) will be bundled in with your Trust Guard Account.</p>

<p>Zip 2 Tax  has also arranged for you to have a <b>PCI compliance account FREE for the 1st year</b>.$19/mo thereafter. This is the same quarterly compliance scanning service that Trust Guard retails for $197. This new service is designed to allow all Zip2Tax customers to easily <b>meet the requirements of Visa and MasterCard's Payment 
  Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard</b>.<b>Compliance with the PCI standards is required by all ecommerce merchants</b>.</p>
  
<p>The Trust Guard program is a complete security auditing system with a breadth of features that far exceed the basic vulnerability scanning requirements of PCI, CISP and SDP which comprise the PCI Security Standards.  A comprehensive security tool, it includes:
  
  <ul style="margin-left:28px;">
    <li>Access to Trust Guard's web-based Vulnerability Management Portal
    <li>Scheduled quarterly automated vulnerability scans
    <li>Unlimited on-demand manual scans to re-test systems whenever needed
    <li>Detailed instructions to patch all vulnerabilities found during scans
