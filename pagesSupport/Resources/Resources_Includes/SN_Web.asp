<p>This designer sells and supports custom WordPress themes for eCommerce that
    are compatible with Zip2Tax's standard full breakout tax tables. Zip2Tax
    does not offer support for this third party, so questions about uploading
    or configuring the data should be directed to 
  <a href="http://www.sarah-neuber.de/" target="_blank">SN Web Design and Development</a>.
</p>
  <h3>Instructions for uploading Zip2Tax's tables into SW Web Design's WordPress
    themes:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    1) Buy the standard &quot;<a href="/free-sales-tax-calculator">Full
    Breakout</a>&quot; tax data table for the location
    you need to collect taxes for.</p>
  <p>2.)&nbsp;You will receive a link to download a&nbsp;<strong>.csv</strong>&nbsp;file.
    Save it as you will need it in step 6 below!</p>
      <p>3.)&nbsp;Download&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.neuber-web-solutions.de/downloads/upload-zip2tax.zip">upload-zip2tax.zip</a></p>
      <p>4.)&nbsp;Unzip and&nbsp;upload the php file you see into your
        WP root directory&nbsp;(i.e. same level as your&nbsp;wp-config.php.)
        From your web host's file manager, look for the wp-config.php file in
        a folder named Public_html.</p>
  <p>5.)&nbsp;Make sure you are&nbsp;logged&nbsp;in to your
        WordPress installation as admin (the file is access protected!) and call
        the file in the browser: <strong>http://www.your-site.com/upload-zip2tax.php</strong></p>
      <p>6.)&nbsp;You will see a form.&nbsp;Upload the .csv file you received
    from zip2tax&nbsp;(see step 2 above)  </p>

    7) Configure your theme settings so that the appropriate state is selected
  and &quot;Destination based&quot; is set as the sourcing rule.</p>

    8) The shopping cart script fetches the appropriate rate based on the entered
    zip (checkout step 2) and calculates the sales tax amount (checkout step
    3).<br>
