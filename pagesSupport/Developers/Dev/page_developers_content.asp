      <p><span class="firstword">The Database Interface</span> connection will allow your eCommerce
       platform or SaaS package to retrieve real-time sales and use tax rates while instantly validating addresses
       as you need them, saving you time, and even more importantly, saving your company money. The Database 
       Interface data updates behind the scenes every month so your programmers can &ldquo;set it and forget it&rdquo; and you
       can concentrate on your business.</p>
      
      <p><span class="firstword">Secure yet versatile</span>, Zip2Tax&rsquo;s <a href="/developers-api"> API</a> is the recommended connection method.
      The API is available at <a href="/developers-api-zipcode"> ZIP code</a>, <a href="/developers-api-zip-plus-4"> ZIP+4</a> and <a href="/developers-api-spot-on"> SpotOn</a> levels and supports both sales and use tax rates. 
      Zip2Tax will continue to support several legacy <a href="/Website/pagesSupport/pagesDev/z2t_developers_DirectConnect.asp"> direct connect</a> and <a href="/developers-passing-variables"> passing request variables</a> variable connections, 
      however these methods do not allow for ZIP+4, SpotOn or use tax queries. </p>
        
      <p><span class="firstword">On the following pages</span>  we describe these methods as well as give you
       working samples to program with. When experimenting with the programming samples, keep in mind that the 
       sample username and password restrict the lookup queries to a ZIP code range from between 90001 and 90999. 
       After you subscribe to one of our services or request a free trial account, simply replace the sample 
       username and password with those issued to you to gain full access.</p>

      <p><span class="firstword">.CSV tax tables:</span> We also include in this section a page showing how to download our .CSV tax tables via an <a href="/developers-table-download"> HTTP request</a> . This is not related to the Database Interface subscription but is included in this section since it involves programing skills to accomplish.</p>
