      <p><span class="firstword">This API</span>
      provides for  XML or JSON responses at the ZIP+4 or ZIP code levels.
      The simpliest way to view  results is to click on one of the sample 
	  links below or paste the link into any browser's URL box. Just pass 
	  in an address, or portion of an address, and leave the username as 
	  &quot;sample&quot; and password as &quot;password&quot;. The 
	  response results will be returned in the appropriate format 
	  determined by the URL you have used.</p>
	  
      <p>This sample query string will allow for unlimited testing with 
	  addresses found within the ZIP codes from 90001 to 90999. If you 
	  would like to perform testing outside of that range, please call 
	  866-492-8494 or <a href="mailto:info@zip2tax.com">e-mail</a> us to 
	  request a free limited-time account. For subscription information,

      <p>Click on the sample code below to see what the ZIP+4 level 
	  result would look like in browser for a ZIP+4 code in Beverly 
	  Hills, California. In a practical application you would 
	  typically read the results into a XMLHttpRequest object.
