            <p>Why do some businesses add nothing extra for tax, some add 4%, and 
			some add 4.166%? The reason depends first on whether the business 
			chooses to visibly pass on the tax or not, and second, if visibly 
			passed on, the extent to which the business chooses to recover the 
			general excise tax expense incurred on the transaction through a 
			specific charge to the customer.</p>
			
            <p>IF the business does not add anything extra for tax, then the 
			business has chosen not to visibly pass on its general excise tax 
			expense.</p>
			
			<p><strong>EXAMPLE 1</strong> - Business X charges its customers $125; 
			it does not visibly pass on its general excise tax expense. The customer 
			pays $125 to X, and X pays $5 (4% of $125) in general excise tax to the 
			State. Part of the remaining $120 (the $125 total price less the $5 tax 
			paid) will be used by X to pay its other expenses; the rest is X's profit.<br>
			IF the business adds 4% extra for tax, then the business has chosen to 
			visibly pass on its general excise tax expense, and to recover 4% of a 
			base amount from customers to pay the general excise tax expense 
			incurred on the transaction. The 4% recovered is part of the total price 
			subject to the general excise tax.</p>
			
			<p><strong>EXAMPLE 2</strong> - Business Y charges its customers a base 
			amount of $125 and visibly passes on an additional $5 (4% of $125) for 
			a total price of $130 ($125 + $5). The customer pays $130 to Y, and Y 
			pays $5.20 (4% of $130) in general excise tax to the State. Part of the 
			remaining $124.80 (the $130 total price less the $5.20 tax paid) will be 
			used by Y to pay its other expenses; the rest is Y's profit. <strong>IF 
			the business adds 4.166% extra for tax, then the business has chosen to 
			visibly pass on its general excise tax expense, and to recover 4.166% of 
			a base amount from customers to pay the general excise tax expense 
			incurred on the transaction.</strong></p>
			
			<p><strong>EXAMPLE 3</strong> - Business Z charges its customers a base 
			amount of $125 and visibly passes on an additional $5.21 (4.166% of $125) 
			for a total price of $130.21 ($125 + $5.21). The customer pays $130.21 to 
			Z, and Z pays $5.21 (4% of $130.21) in general excise tax to the State. 
			Part of the remaining $125 (the $130.21 total price less the $5.21 tax 
			paid) will be used by Z to pay its other expenses; the rest is Z's profit.</p>

			<p>In the three examples above, note that, although the amount of general 
			excise tax paid to the State differed, the percentage due the State in 
			general excise tax was the same (i.e., 4%).</p>
