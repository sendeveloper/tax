            <p>The tax tables have been standardized to work for the entire country. This has 
			forced us to make some generalizations in the data fields that may or may not 
			match up perfectly with every state's structure. An example would be the parishes 
			of Loisianna appearing in the county column.</p>
            <p>Some columns may be blank because that particular state has a different taxing 
			structure. This occurs frequently with the reporting code columns since many 
			states do not require them.</p>
