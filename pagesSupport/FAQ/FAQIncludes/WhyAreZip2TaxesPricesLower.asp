			  <p>Zip2Tax is an affordable alternative to the mega-sized tax rate 
			  providers that often charge thousands if not hundreds of thousands 
			  of dollars a year.</p>
			  <p>How can Zip2Tax afford to charge so much less? The short answer 
			  is: we are a lean company.</p>
		    </div>			
			<p>Zip2Tax relies on a small core of key personnel and we don't keep 
			staff sitting around waiting to up-sell you.</p>
			<p>The big tax companies use commission-driven sales and marketing 
			staff who's sole purpose is to hover by the phones and harangue 
			prospective customers. They don't tell you what their fees are until 
			after they have all of your personal information and they have you on 
			the phone. We publish our full rates right on our web page and let 
			you decide for yourself if our services are right for your company.</p>
			<p>We provide samples of our data and set-up information right on our 
			web site. Most of our customers are do-it-yourselfers who are able to 
			integrate our data for themselves. Meanwhile, our competition employs 
			dozens of programers who are poised to sweep into your shop and 
			commandeer your databases. They have lots of smiling young MBAs who 
			are eager to hold your staff hostage in long training seminars.</p>
			<p>Zip2Tax doesn't offer tax filing services or guarantees of audit 
			protection. We've found that the majority of our clients prefer to use 
			their own accountants, or are interested in a referral to one of our 
			affiliates who offer special deals to Zip2Tax customers. This makes it 
			possible for us to forego the stable of CPAs, tax law specialists and 
			lawyers the competition must maintain.</p>
			<p>Based on the trim size of our company and our commitment to stay 
			focused on what we do best - providing accurate sales and use tax data 
			affordably to autonomous businesses - the difference between us and 
			our competition is clear.</p>
