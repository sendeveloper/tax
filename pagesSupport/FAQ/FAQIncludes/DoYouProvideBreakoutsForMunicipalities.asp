          <p>We offer sales tax breakouts for state, county, city and special districts. These 
		  breakouts have the municipal sales tax rate as well as the reporting code, where 
		  applicable. These columns will be left blank for those localities that do not require 
		  reporting codes or do not have their own sales tax rates.</p>
		  
          <p><a href="/free-sales-tax-calculator#PageSection1" target="_blank">
		  Online Lookup Service:</a> Breakouts are available to our Online Lookup Service 
		  subscribers by hovering your mouse over the tax rate on the ZIP Code to Sales Tax 
		  Calculator. A pop-up window will appear showing the breakout rates. A menu will 
		  appear below the main window showing the names and tax rates of other communities 
		  sharing the same ZIP code.</p>
            
          <p><a href="/free-sales-tax-calculator#PageSection2" target="_blank">
		  Database Interface:</a> Breakouts are now available to our Database Interface 
		  subscribers. Current Database Interface subscribers need do nothing if they wish to 
		  continue to receive aggregate sales tax data. Current and new Database Interface 
		  subscribers have the choice of linking to the aggregate data or to receive the full 
		  breakout version. Sample test codes for both types are available in our Developers 
		  section for Direct Connection or Passing Request Variables</p>
            
          <p><a href="/free-sales-tax-calculator#PageSection3" 
		  target="_blank">Sales and Use Tax Tables:</a> Breakout data is the standard format 
		  available to all Sales and Use Tax Table subscribers. The Breakout style table 
		  contains all of the information that Zip2Tax collects.</p>
		  
          <p>We also have tables formatted to provide less information than the Breakout style, 
		  such as the Basic (a single tax sum combining all municipal levels, and the Unique 
		  ZIPs (one row per ZIP code based on the "Primary Record," the municipality housing 
		  the U.S. Post Office.) We also have tables designed to work with specific shopping 
		  carts and eCommerce systems that organize the data differently than the Breakout 
		  version. Please check the Sample Tables and Layout Information found on the 
		  <a href="/Website/pagesProducts/z2t_specialty_tables.asp" target="_blank">Services 
		  Page</a> for each type of table to see which one will work best with your software.</p>
