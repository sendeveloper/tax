            <p>Yes. In the United States, a 5 digit ZIP code can encompass many square 
			miles. This area will frequently contain several different cities and towns 
			and sometime cross county boundaries. So a lookup based on ZIP code may 
			return several possible results. Zip2Tax provides each result so you can 
			choose the most appropriate match.</p>
			
            <p>A ZIP+4 lookup will narrow the results down to about one side of a road 
			about a block long. This could still potentially cross city and county 
			boundaries.</p>
			
            <p>Zip2Tax's Spot-On&trade; lookups ascertain a jurisdiction by exact, validated 
			street address. This method will only provide one result for that door step.</p>
