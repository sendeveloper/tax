              <p>We've determined that our standard .CSV Tax Tables integrate
                very  well with many shopping carts which allow importation of
                data. In fact,  several eCommerce providers have purposely developed
                their shopping  carts to make sure our data import flawlessly.
                If you are in the  market for a new provider, please check out
                our list of  
			  <a href="/Website/pagesProducts/z2t_compatible.asp" target="_blank">compatible
			  systems</a>.</p>
			  
              <p>We also offer a selection of specially formatted tables for some 
			  of the most popular eCommerce systems. Please check out our selection 
			  of <a href="/Website/pagesProducts/z2t_specialty_tables.asp" target="_blank">specialty tables</a>.</p>
			  
              <p>We can also provide our tax data through a variety of database 
			  linking methods available at our 
			  <a href="/developers-interface" target="_blank">
			  Developers page</a>. Here, your developer or IT professional can 
			  access a portion of our live data for testing purposes. The codes 
			  provided use a sample username and password which will allow you access 
			  to real-time data for ZIP codes between 90001 and 90999. If you 
			  subscribe to one of our services, you'll be able to replace the sample 
			  username and password with those issued to you, thereby gaining full 
			  access without having to alter the rest of the tested code. Your 
			  developer should be able to determine which method will work best to 
			  meet your needs.</p>
