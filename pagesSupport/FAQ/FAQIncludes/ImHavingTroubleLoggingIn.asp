            <li class="indent1">Close every page you have open in your browser and open a 
			fresh session.
			<li class="indent2">If a browser is left open for a long period of time, it will 
			point to the version of a page as it was when the browser was first opened. 
			Sometimes a small change has occurred on that page and the browser is unable to 
			match up the two slightly different occurrences which causes a login failure.</li>
