			<p><a href="/Website/pagesProducts/Cart/Online_SpotOn/online_SpotOn_popup.asp" 
			target="_blank">Spot-On</a> gives you the ability to input and validate a full street 
			address, therefore it will only return more than one possible location if the address 
			cannot be found. In those cases it will provide results to the next closest location, 
			usually ZIP+4.</p>
				
			<p><a href="/Website/pagesProducts/Cart/Online_Zip+4/online_zip+4_popup.asp" 
			target="_blank">ZIP+4</a> subscriptions allow you to input a nine digit postal code and 
			will provide granularity down to one side of a street for a range of addresses. This 
			will sometimes result in more than one tax jurisdiction. In those cases you will see 
			the most likely match first, followed by other possible matches lower on the page. You 
			can then manually choose the one you want. If no exact match is found, the results for 
			a five digit ZIP code lookup will be displayed.</p>
			
			<p><a href="/Website/pagesProducts/Cart/Online_Zip/online_zip_popup.asp" target="_blank">
			ZIP code</a> lookups often return more than one possible matching result. The default 
			result will provide the rate for the Primary Record - the town within the ZIP code where 
			the U.S. Post Office is located. A menu will appear below the main window showing the 
			names and tax rates of other communities sharing the same ZIP code. You can then 
			manually determine which municipality you are looking for.</p>
