              <p>With the <a href="/Website/Downloads/Sample_Tables/zip2tax_Sample.csv">
			  Full Breakout table</a> you can search by ZIP code, which will frequently 
			  return more than one row. You can manually or programmatically choose which 
			  of the rows most closely matches the jurisdiction you are looking for, or 
			  you can default to the row with a "1" in the  Primary Record column if you 
			  want to return only one result.</p>
			  
              <p>Some of the <a href="/Website/pagesProducts/z2t_specialty_tables.asp" 
			  target="_blank">specialty table formats</a> do not provide more than one 
			  result per ZIP code, and some do not provide breakdowns by jurisdiction. 
			  Tax tables are <a href="/Website/pagesExtra/z2t_refundpolicy.asp" 
			  target="_blank">non-refundable</a>, so it is highly recommended that you 
			  check out the sample tables and read the table layout descriptions prior 
			  to purchase.</p>
