            <p>Yes, all of our services include information about the taxability
              of shipping.  With the Online Lookup, the shipping information
              is show at the bottom of the lookup window. With Database Interface
              and Tax Tables, Shipping is taxable if  there is a "1" in that
              field and not taxable if there is a "0".</p>
			
            <p>If there is any variance on the taxability of shipping depending on certain 
			rules, such as whether or not it is separated out on the invoice, we have 
			defaulted to "0" for non-taxable.</p>
			
            <p>Our services do not separate shipping and handling charges.</p>
