            <p>We've found that sometimes corporate cards have security settings applied to 
			their accounts that cause Zip2Tax's shopping cart to generate a "Payment Processor 
			Error: Credit Card rejected: General decline of the card. No other information 
			provided by the issuing bank."</p>
			
            <p>This is usually the result of a security setting applied by the account holder 
			and is usually designed to prevent the card from being used for unauthorized 
			purchases.</p>
			
            <p>In most instances, this can be easily remedied by calling the 800 number on the 
			back of the card and describing the service you are trying to purchase. In other 
			cases, using the corporate card of someone with administrative privileges won't 
			set off the security warnings.</p>
			
            <p>If none of the above remedies work, just call our offices at (866) 492-8494 and 
			we can process the payment manually.</p>
