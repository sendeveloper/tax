            <p>Many times tax districts are based on factors other than ZIP code. There 
			are locations within certain states that have more than one tax 
			jurisdiction for a single ZIP code. This can make it tricky to determine 
			which rate to use based solely upon the 5 digit ZIP code.</p>
			
            <p>We offer ZIP+4 and Spot-On subscriptions to 
			<a href="/free-sales-tax-calculator#PageSection2" target="_blank">
			Database Interface</a> and <a href="/free-sales-tax-calculator#PageSection1" 
			target="_blank">Online Lookup</a> subscribers to make it easier for you to find the 
			jurisdiction you require. To learn more about the different

            <p>The <a href="/free-sales-tax-calculator#PageSection3" 
			target="_blank">.CSV Tax Tables</a> are available at the ZIP code level 
			only. We've made it possible for you determine which rate to use by 
			providing multiple results for ZIP codes with more than one community. 
			The default result is the municipality that is home to the U.S. Post 
			Office - in the Tax Tables, this location is denoted with a "1" in the 
			Primary Record column. The other rows for that ZIP code show all of the 
			other communities sharing the same ZIP code.</p>
			
			<p>You can manually select the row with the closest city match, or, if 
			you are a Database Interface or Tax Tables subscriber, you may be able 
			to program your systems to automatically make the match.</p>
