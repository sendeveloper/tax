            <p>Is shipping taxable?  Just for once, wouldn't it be great if this was a "yes" or "no"?  
			Oct. 2011  By Jim Frazier <a href="http://salestaxguy.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">The Sales Tax Guy</a></p>
			
            <p>The taxability of freight or delivery charges is one of the most frequently asked 
			questions. And the rules vary all over the place. In more than half the states, freight 
			charges are taxable. This means that you would add the charges to the merchandise total 
			in determining the basis for the tax calculation.</p>
			
			<p>This means that, if the sale is taxable, then the freight will be taxable in those 
			states. But if the sale is not taxable (eg. manufacturing equipment or resale), freight 
			isn't taxable. Here are some additional points. Remember though, that whether or not 
			freight is taxable is only a question if the sale is taxable.</p>
			
			<p>1. If the seller is actually separately showing his inbound freight (for deliveries 
			TO the seller), then that charge is generally included in the basis - it's taxable. For 
			freight charges to be non-taxable, they can only be for shipments from the seller to the 
			buyer.<br>
			2. In states where shipping charges are NOT included in the basis, there are usually 
			restrictions. Here's a laundry list of the possible requirements. Note that these are 
			highly variable:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li class="indent1">Is the freight charge separately stated? This is universal. For 
			  shipping charges to be non-taxable, they must be separately stated on the invoice.</li>
			  <li class="indent1">If the sale terms are FOB origin, then the freight isn't taxable. 
			  Does the ownership transfer at the shipping point?</li>
			  <li class="indent1">The seller can't make a profit on the delivery charge: the charge 
			  better be pretty close to what the carrier actually charged the vendor. If the seller's 
			  freight charge is more than the freight he paid, the freight charge is taxable.</li>
			  <li class="indent1">Did the seller ship via common carrier or in his own vehicle?</li>
			  <li class="indent1">Does the buyer have the option of arranging their own shipment or 
			  going and picking up the goods at the seller location?</li>
			  <li class="indent1">Was the freight charge separately agreed upon? In some states, 
			  having it be on a separate line on an order form is enough. In other states, it must 
			  be a separate physical contract. In other states, it depends on the precise wording of 
			  the agreement. If there's any restriction that is a highly gray area, this is the one.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Shipping charges billed directly to the buyer by a common carrier are generally not 
			taxable (these are "collect" charges). The buyer owes no use tax on those charges.</p>

			<p>Please remember that this is a taxing policy that is highly variable from state to 
			state. You need to research this carefully.</p>
			
			<p>Then there are those "easy" states who just say "Is the sale taxable? Then the freight 
			is taxable." I love those states.<p>
