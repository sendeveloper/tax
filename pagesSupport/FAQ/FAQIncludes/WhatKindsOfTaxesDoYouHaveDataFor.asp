            <p>Our data covers general sales and use taxes. We also provide information
              on the  taxability of shipping. We do not currently provide rate
              or rule data for specific  products or services.</p>

			<p>Laws pertaining to the taxability of certain products, business types,
			  and services vary greatly from state to state. Zip2Tax is evaluating the
			  feasibility of providing data for additional tax types such as automobiles,
			  alcoholic beverages, software, and more. If you would like to suggest
			  another type of tax, or if you'd be interested in receiving notice when
			  a tax type is added to our services, please e-mail your request to <a href="mailto:info@zip2tax.com">info@zip2tax.com</a>.</p>
