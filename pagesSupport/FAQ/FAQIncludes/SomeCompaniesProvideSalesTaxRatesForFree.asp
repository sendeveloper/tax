		    <p>Sales tax providers that offer their services for free are usually 
			associated with the 
			<a href="http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/index.php?page=faqs" 
			target="_blank">Streamline Sales Tax Agreement</a>. There are currently 
			six companies certified with SSTA and they are paid directly by the 
			states for their services. The states are happy to pay for these 
			services because when a merchant signs up for these "free tax rate 
			services," their company is automatically registered with each and 
			every state taking part in the agreement and they will end up having to 
			pay sales taxes to every state. These free service providers tell you 
			how much to collect in sale tax, but then they take full control over 
			the reporting and remittance to the states - even going so far as to 
			automatically withdraw the funds from your bank account.</p>
			<p>These free services can be a godsend for small companies who can't 
			handle their existing remittance burden, but the level of control that 
			they are handing over to these providers is enormous.</p>
			<p>Just keep in mind that any service provider is naturally going to 
			work in the interest of the person who holds the purse strings - the states.</p>
